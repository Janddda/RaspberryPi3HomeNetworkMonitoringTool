What is this: Master's Thesis Project, Computer Science, Cal Poly Pomona.
This tool was created to easily detect free riders on your home network and be able to kick them off without logging on to the router. 
It was made to be running on a Raspberry Pi with Kali Linux but can be installed on any Linux distribution with the correct dependencies installed.
